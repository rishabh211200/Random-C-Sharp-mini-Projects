. The application should allow the staff of ABC to input data such as numbers and text for storing it in a database. Rishabh wants
that a user of application must be allowed to enter only numeric values for the number field and character values for the text
field such as name and  address. He also wants that a proper message should be displayed if a user enter character values in number 
fields. How can Rishabh apply this functionality in the application?
